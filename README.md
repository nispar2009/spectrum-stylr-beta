# spectrum-stylr-beta

Introducing SpectrumStylr Beta, with sleeker fonts and design. Refer to the SpectrumStylr legacy docs for most of the features at "nispar2009.github.io/spectrum_stylr/docsHome.html".

New settings have been added for buttons with simple alert types such as btn-danger, btn-warning, btn-info, and btn-success. Use the btn class for all buttons.
