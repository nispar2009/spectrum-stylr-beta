# spectrum-stylr-beta

Introducing SpectrumStylr Beta, with sleeker fonts and design. Refer to the SpectrumStylr legacy docs for most of the features at "https://nispar2009.github.io/spectrum_stylr/docsHome.html".

New settings have been added for buttons with simple alert types such as btn-danger, btn-warning, btn-info, and btn-success. Use the btn class for all buttons. If needed, one can also use btn-outline with the above alerts. On its own, btn can be used to render a minimalist button, but it isn't compatible with btn-outline.

To create a joined effect in single-field forms, delete any characters between the field and the submit button. Give the field class="form-join" and the button should be given class="btn-join".

Tables are now striped by default using the table class. Classes such as table-active and table-striped are no longer in use.
